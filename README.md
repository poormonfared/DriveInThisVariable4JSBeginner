# DriveInThisVariable4JSBeginner
This is sometimes gets quite frustrating to understand for JS beginner developers. The value of "This" variable!

The value of _this_ depends on invocation pattern. there are four possible invocations as below:

1- method invocation

2- function invocation

3- constructor invocation

4- apply invocation

For each situation, we add sample code for conterbuter to rapidly drive deep in this concept. if you enjoy! just add new common related sample for other contributers.
